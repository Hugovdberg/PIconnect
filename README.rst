A python connector to the OSISoft PI and PI-AF databases
========================================================

This connector allows access to the OSISoft PI System through their proprietary SDK. It
provides a number of classes, mostly mirroring the AF SDK structure, but at the same time
implementing the cool stuff we use Python for. Connections to the database are therefore
implemented as context managers, to allow opening a connection using a with statement.
